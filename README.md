# ThumbWars: A Open-Source Bitcoin Miner Hardware Competition

## Competition Overview
"ThumbWars" is an Open-Source Bitcoin miner hardware competition designed to accelerate innovation in Bitcoin mining technology. Participants are encouraged to develop their own mining hardware and firmware solutions. The competition forking runs until September 30 2024.

## Key Dates
- **Start Date:** Immediate
- **fork Deadline:** September 30
- **No Alterations to fork After:** October 1, 2024
- **Winners Announced:** November 1, 2024

## Categories for Judging
Participants' entries will be evaluated based on the following four categories:

1. **Hashrate:**
   - Higher hashrates will score better in this category.

2. **Efficiency:**
   - The energy efficiency of the mining hardware.
   - Entries will be judged on their power consumption relative to their hashrate.

3. **Firmware Integration and Ease of Use:**
   - The quality and usability of the provided firmware.
   - Ease of installation, configuration, and operation will be considered.

4. **Affordability to Manufacture:**
   - The cost-effectiveness of producing the mining hardware.
   - Lower manufacturing costs will score higher in this category.


## Competition Rules
1. **Eligibility:**
   - Open to individuals and teams.
   - Each entry must be an original design developed by the participant(s).

2. **Hardware Requirements:**
   - Entries must include both the mining hardware and the accompanying firmware.
   - The hardware must be functional and capable of mining Bitcoin.
   - The design dimensions must not exceed 80 mm in length and 40 mm in width.
   - The design must adhere to the specified thumb drive form factor (see Form Factor section).
   - ASICs can be powered separately, allowing for two power sources.
   - You can use as many ASIC chips as desired, but keep in mind that efficiency and hashrate will be major factors in the scoring.
   - Mining data must be transmitted through the USB interface.

3. **Submission Guidelines:**
   - Participants must fork the official ThumbWars repository.
   - Submit a detailed description of their hardware design, including schematics, parts list, and assembly instructions.
   - Firmware should be provided as a downloadable package with documentation.
   - A video demonstration showing the hardware in operation is required.
   - No alterations can be made to your fork after October 1, 2024.

4. **Judging Process:**
   - An expert panel of judges will evaluate each entry based on the five categories.
   
5. **Intellectual Property:**
   - All entries must be completely open-source, with designs and firmware made publicly available.
   - Participants must use commonly used open-source licenses, ensuring the designs are available for public use and modification.

## Form Factor
- The design must adhere to a thumb drive form factor, ensuring it is compact and portable.
- The maximum dimensions are 80 mm in length and 40 mm in width.
- The design should include a USB connector for data transmission and power connectivity, maintaining the appearance and functionality of a typical thumb drive.

## Prizes
